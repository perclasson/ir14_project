The maximum score one could get in an evaluation was 32, indicating that a summary of the query subject was returned for every query. The average we got across all different permutations of parameters values was 15.375. The best combination of parameter values was 5, 1, 5 and 5 (the order of these values are as described in the evaluation) which gave a score of 15. For the different parameters in our evaluation we calculated some average scores:

Of course, these parameters do of course work in combination, and changing one affects the others. Still, these averages should give some indication of the relative importance of the variables different values.
