\section{Background}
Today, information is becoming abundant. There is a vast amount of information available on the Internet and this amount is only growing in size. Because of the expanding set of relevant data, it is becoming more and more important to construct relevant overviews, which saves one from sifting through a complete corpus in order to get a general idea of a topic. Another problem may arise from the expansion of information itself; as it grows, previous summaries may become obsolete. Information abstraction is therefore an important problem to solve.

Automatic text summarization is a way of solving this problem. The idea is that texts have inherent structures that can be exploited in order to find relevant data. Different methods such as abstraction (which attempts to summarize the text in natural language) and extraction (which returns important sentences from the text itself) may be employed, either by themselves or in conjunction.

\section{Problem}
The aim of this project is to build a tool that takes a search string from a user and gives context information about the query subject back to the user. The information, taking the form of the top most informative sentences about the subject, was to come from Wikipedia.
